usaco-solutions
===============

This is a compilation of C++ solutions to the USACO training gate problems. 

They were all programmed by myself, with occasional reference to the magical internet.

Please don't mind the poor quality of code, it was my first real experience with C++ and I was going for coding time and efficiency over clean code (as you should btw!!).

Feel free to mention all errors/problems/ineffeciencies. As far as I know, all of these solutions work in the needed time.

The solutions currently only go up to section 3.2, but I may decide to get back into contest problems later. 

I would definitely be open to others uploading their solutions to later problems, so let me know!
